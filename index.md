## Olympic Channel Broadcasts

**Next Broadcast** Hoping that they play the USA v Colombia final one more time. I'll add it here if I find it.

The Olympic Channel broadcasts of the USA games are generally taped and broadcast at a later time, but live streams of the games can be found as well (see above). The broadcasts tend to be of higher quality than the live streams, but only some games are broadcast it seems.
